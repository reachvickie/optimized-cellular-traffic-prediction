**Optimized Cellular Traffic Prediction using Machine Learning**
This repository contains the code and resources for the project "Optimized Cellular Traffic Forecasting Using Machine Learning and Data Compression Techniques". This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based approach for cellular traffic prediction, leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) alongside data reduction techniques to enhance model efficiency and performance.


About The Project
The rapid growth in cellular network usage demands accurate and efficient traffic prediction models to ensure optimal network management and resource allocation. This project aims to provide a reliable and efficient tool for cellular network operators, enabling effective network resource management and ensuring a seamless user experience. By utilizing historical traffic data, the proposed system leverages LSTM algorithms to predict future traffic patterns, helping network operators anticipate congestion and optimize bandwidth allocation.

Methodology
The methodology for this project involved several key stages:


Data Collection and Preprocessing: The dataset used in this study comes from a large-scale 4G LTE network, providing real-time data on user traffic patterns, resource allocation, and service quality metrics. Missing data points were handled using interpolation techniques, and outliers and noise were mitigated using Z-score analysis.






LSTM Model Design: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks were chosen for their ability to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data, which is crucial for modeling the temporal relationships in cellular traffic patterns. The model architecture consists of two LSTM layers, each followed by dropout layers for regularization.




Data Reduction Techniques: To reduce computational overhead and optimize processing efficiency, two key techniques were employed: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and feature selection. PCA was used to transform the dataset into a reduced set of orthogonal components, while a correlation-based feature selection method was used to retain the most relevant variables.





Results
The LSTM model's performance was evaluated and compared against traditional methods like ARIMA and SVM. The results demonstrated that the LSTM model consistently outperforms both in terms of prediction accuracy, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.005, compared to 0.012 for ARIMA and 0.009 for SVM. The DNN-LSTM model achieved the highest accuracy of 98.84% compared to other machine learning models.
